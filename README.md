Miscellaneous small projects.

Projects (if you can call them that) are sorted into language directories.

## `c++` ##

### `switchlike` ###

Like `switch`, but with more features.  See `c++/src/switchlike.cpp` for
details.

## `perl5` ##

### `ant2gv.pl` ##

Draws graphs of target dependencies in Ant files.  Mostly works, but has some
limitations regarding dependencies to targets in other files.
